1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for segment routing
   configuration and operation.

1.1.  Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Section 2.

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" state data (read-only).

Internet-Draft                 sr-yang-cfg                    March 2015


   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

3.  Configuration

   This module augments the "/rt:routing/rt:routing-instance:" with a
   segment-routing container.  This container defines all the
   configuration parameters related to segment-routing for this
   particular routing-instance.

   The segment-routing configuration is split in global configuration
   and interface configuration.

   The global configuration defines :

   o  segment-routing transport type : the standard model supports only
      MPLS as segment-routing dataplane.  The transport-type is defined
      only once for a particular routing-instance and is agnostic to the
      control plane used.  Only a single transport-type is supported
      now.

   o  bindings : defines how external informations may be advertised as
      a segment ID.  The current version supports the mapping-server
      where static bindings can be defined (prefix to SID bindings).
      Configuration of bindings does not allow advertisement of those
      bindings.  Advertisement must be controlled by each controlplane.

   o  SRGB (Segment Routing Global Block) : defines a list of label
      blocks defined as pair of lower-bound/upper-bound where the node
      will pick up for Prefix-SID.  The SRGB is also agnostic to the
      controlplane to be used.  So all controlplanes will have to
      advertise the same SRGB.

   The interface configuration defines :

   o  Adjacency SID properties

   o  Prefix SID properties

3.1.  Adjacency SID properties

   In case of parallel IP links between routers, an additional Adjacency
   SID may be advertised for each parallel adjacency with a common
   value.  The "authorize-bundle" configuration defines if operator
   wants to enable such behavior.

   The "advertise-protection" defines how protection of an interface
   should be advertised.  It does not control the activation or
   deactivation of the protection.  If "single" option is used, a single
   Adj-SID will be added to the interface.  If the interface is
   protected, the B flag of the adjacency will reflect this state.  If

Internet-Draft                 sr-yang-cfg                    March 2015


   "dual" option is used and if the interface is protected, two
   adjacency segments will be associated with the adjacencies present on
   the interface.  One Adj-SID will always have B unset, the other will
   have B set.  This option is intended to be used in case of traffic
   engineering where a path must use protected segments or non protected
   segments.

3.2.  Prefix SID properties

   An interface may own IP prefixes.  By default, no prefix SID will be
   advertised for any IP prefix owned by the interface.

   When adding "prefix-sid" in the interface configuration, the operator
   can control the advertisement of a prefix SID.

   The operator can control advertisement of prefix SID independently
   for IPv4 and IPv6.  Operator is required to set a prefix-sid value.

   The value can be expressed as an index (default), or an absolute
   value.  Operator can also control if the node flag must be set for
   the prefix.  As the router owns the prefix, the default value is to
   advertise node flag as set.

   The last-hop-behavior commands the PHP behavior : explicit-null, php
   or non php.

4.  Control plane configuration

   Activation of segment-routing extensions for a particular control
   plane is done by augmenting routing-protocol configuration with
   segment-routing.

   The "enabled" leaf permits to active advertisement of segment-routing
   extensions within the routing protocol.

   The "binding" container defines the ability for the routing protocol
   to advertise or receive bindings.

   This model supports ISIS ([I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions])
   and OSPF as controlplane
   ([I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-ospfv3-extension]) for segment-
   routing.

5.  States

   The operational states currently contains information about usage of
   allocated label blocks.

   It also provides information on global SID bindings.  A list of all
   globally allocated SIDs is provided associated with information about
   the binding.

6.  Notifications

   The model proposes two notifications for segment-routing.

   o  segment-routing-global-sid-collision : must be raised when a new
      learning through controlplane has an index which is already
      associated with another target.

   o  segment-routing-index-out-of-range : must be raised when a new
      learning through controlplane has an index which is outside the
      SRGB configured on the node.

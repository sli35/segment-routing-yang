	<section anchor="how" title="Configuration">
	<t>
	This module augments the "/rt:routing/rt:routing-instance:" with a segment-routing container.
	This container defines all the configuration parameters related to segment-routing for this particular routing-instance.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	The segment-routing configuration is split in global routing-instance configuration and interface configuration.
	</t>
	<t>The global configuration includes :
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>segment-routing transport type : The underlying transport type 
      for segment routing. The version of the model limits the transport
      type to an MPLS dataplane. The transport-type is only defined once
      for a particular routing-instance and is agnostic to the
      control plane used.  Only a single transport-type is supported
      in this version of the model. </t>
	<t>bindings : Defines how external information is mapped to 
      a segment ID.  The current version supports a mapping-server
      where static prefix-to-SID bindings can be defined. 
      Configuration of bindings does not allow advertisement of those
      bindings.  Advertisement must be controlled by each 
      routing-protocol instance.</t>
	<t>SRGB (Segment Routing Global Block): Defines a list of label
      blocks reprsented by a pair of lower-bound/upper-bound labels. 
      The SRGB is also agnostic to the control plane used. So all
      routing-protocol instance will have to advertise the same SRGB.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>The interface configuration includes :
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>Adjacency SID properties</t>
	<t>Prefix SID properties</t>
	</list>

		<section anchor="adj-cfg" title="Adjacency SID properties">
			<section anchor="adj-cfg-bundling" title="Bundling">
			<t>
			In case of parallel IP links between routers, an additional Adjacency
	   SID may be advertised representing more than one adjacency (i.e., 
	   a bundle of adjacencies). The "advertise-adj-group-sid" configuration 
	   controls whether or not an additional adjacency SID is advertised.
			</t>
			<t>The "advertise-adj-group-sid" would be a list of "group-id".
			The "group-id" will permit to identify interfaces that must
			be bundled together.</t>

+-------+                 +------+
|       | ------- L1 ---- |      |

			</figure>
			<t>
			In the figure above, R1 and R2 are interconnected by four links. A routing protocol adjacency is established on each link.
			Operator would like to create segment-routing Adj-SID that represent some bundles of links. We can imagine two different bundles : L1/L2 and L2/L3.
			To achieve this behavior, the service provider will configure a "group-id" X for both interfaces L1 and L2 and a "group-id" Y for both interfaces L3 and L3.
			This will result in R1 advertising an additional Adj-SID for each adjacency, for example a Adj-SID with S flag set and value of 400 will be added to L1 and L2.
			A Adj-SID with S flag set and value of 500 will be added to L3 and L4. As L1/L2 and L3/L4 does not share the same "group-id", a different SID value will be allocated.
			</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="adj-cfg-protection" title="Protection">
			<t>
			The "advertise-protection" defines how protection for an interface
	   is advertised.  It does not control the activation or deactivation of 
	   protection.  If the "single" option is used, a single Adj-SID will be
	   advertised for the interface.  If the interface is protected, the 
	   B-Flag for the Adj-SID advertisement will be set. If the "dual" 
	   option is used and if the interface is protected, two Adj-SIDs will
	   be advertised for the interface adjacencies. One Adj-SID will always
	   have the B-Flag set and the other will have the B-Flag clear.  This
	   option is intended to be used in the case of traffic engineering 
	   where a path must use either protected segments or non-protected
	   segments.

		<section anchor="prefix-cfg" title="Prefix SID properties">
		<t>
		An interface may have associated IP prefixes.  By default, no 
   Prefix-SID will be advertised for any IP prefix associated with an
   interface.
		</t>
		<t>The operator can control the advertisement of IP prefixes by setting 
   "prefix-sid" in the interface configuration.</t>
		<t>The operator can control advertisement of Prefix-SID independently
   for IPv4 and IPv6.  When specified, the "prefix-sid" value must be
   included.</t>
		<t>The value can be expressed as an index (default), or an absolute
   value.  The operator can also control if the "node-flag" is
   set for the prefix.  As the network device owns the prefix, the
   default is to advertise the prefix with the "node-flag" set.</t>
		<t>The "last-hop-behavior" configuration dictates the PHP behavior: 
   "explicit-null", "php", or "non-php".</t>

	<section anchor="cp" title="Control plane configuration">
	<t>
	Activation of segment-routing extensions for a particular control plane is done by augmenting routing-protocol configuration with segment-routing.
	</t>
	<t>The "enabled" leaf enables segment-routing extensions for the 
   routing-protocol instance.</t>
	<t>The "bindings" container controls the routing-protocol instance's
   advertisement of local bindings and the processing of received 
   bindings.</t>
	<t>This model supports ISIS (<xref target="I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions"/>) and OSPF as controlplane (<xref target="I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions"/> and <xref target="I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-ospfv3-extension"/>) for segment-routing.</t>
